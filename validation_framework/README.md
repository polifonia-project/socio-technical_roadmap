# Validation framework

The validation framework is modular in nature. It includes core criteria to which all pilots must comply: a) the use of a methodological approach combining XD and UX design, b) the inclusion of resources in an ecosystem governed by specific guidelines, c) the presentation of the pilots and (part of) their resources via the web portal; and d) the regular monitoring via the survey. In addition to these criteria, the framework consists of specific validation methods for individual pilots or pilot groups.   

## Core validation criteria 
The compliance of the pilots to a set of common core tools, principles and guidelines grants a methodological and conceptual coherence to the whole while leaving enough space for individual pilot specific validation protocols. 

**a) XD and UX Design:** The strategy consists of applying a mix of eXtreme Design and UX Design through user interviews, personas, stories, competency questions, mock-ups, and interface prototypes. This approach, which is part of design-centered research (RTD) helps unify the design process of the pilots and ensures that their objectives are in line with real needs.

**b) Ecosystem and Rulebook:** The conformity of the pilots (and of their components) to the Ecosystem and its guidelines plays a leading role in the validation process. This criterion ensures that all components that are discussed, presented and published are correctly referenced (O5). The ecosystem also makes sure that the decisions, modifications and progress related to the pilots are documented. 

**c) Web portal:** As a place for disseminating, enhancing and interconnecting the pilots, the web portal helps to harmonize the way Polifonia’s resources can be presented, explored and searched by both amateur and expert users. The design principles based on QC analysis, focused groups to collect users' expectations and frustrations, and protoyping (based on the information collected and feedback from Polifonia researchers) lead to identify and apply shared presentation and interaction patterns. Thus, the web portal is an important validation criterium because it contributes to applying sound methods and approaches and to conveying Polifonia’s ressources to a dedicated and shared place (O5).  

**d) Survey:** The survey provides meticulous documentation on the choices, orientations, resources and objectives of each pilot. It is  the main source where detailed information on the validation methods, the validation protocol and the KPIs used has been collected. The survey thus has a double role: on the one hand, it is a central tool for designing the validation framework presented here. On the other hand, it provides us with a fingerprint of the pilots scientific, technical and socio-pedagogical specificities.  

## Pilot specific methods
The pilot specific methods identified are the result of an in-depth analysis of the answers given by the pilots during several iterations of the survey. methods identified on this basis cover a) the "input data" of the pilots, i.e. the data that serve as starting points for the case studies; b) the tools, means and software bricks by which new knowledge and/or results are produced; and c) the validation of objectives and results. 

**a) Input validation:** The goal of this first validation group is to assess the quality of the data (musical scores, historical texts) with regard to pilot specific needs.  Another objective is to leverage the quality control of the input data to identify what changes have been made to the dataset to suit the pilot requirements.

**b) Validation of tools/means/software:** The objective here is to verify both the robustness and the ergonomics of the technical solutions implemented. 

**c) Output/result validation:** The last subgroup covers the validation of both the objectives and the results of the pilots.
